## IMPORTANT
- **Disconnecting the trrs cable between the left and right sides while connected to power will fry the board. Disconnect the usb-c first before disconnecting the trrs cables**
- Use the QMK configurator if you want to edit the mappings by flashing new firmware: https://config.qmk.fm/#/crkbd/rev4_1/standard/LAYOUT_split_3x6_3
- Firmware upload directions can be found here: https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/blob/main/docs/firmware/rev4/firmware_en.md
  - NOTE: I only do one at a time, not connected with trrs cable
- Sometimes your phone will interfere with the circuitry if it is too close, it's a known issue (sorry) but you just need to keep your phone about a foot away from the keyboard
- This model is known as a crkbd or a "corne" version 4.1, the original repo is here: https://github.com/foostan/crkbd
