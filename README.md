## IMPORTANT
- Disconnecting the trrs cable between the left and right sides while connected to power will fry the board. Disconnect the usb-c first before disconnecting the trrs cables
- Use the QMK configurator if you want to edit the mappings by flashing new firmware: https://config.qmk.fm/#/crkbd/rev4_1/standard/LAYOUT_split_3x6_3
